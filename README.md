# FNB-Project
Scrapping data from online platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, etc., and carrying out analysis on the data and providing overall sentiment of the customer for each restaurant. 

Note: In beautiful soup, we are not able to scroll down the page to scrap all the data. So, used selenium initially to scrap the data and used beautiful soup to pull reviews from the API link.
