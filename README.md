# FNB-Project
Scrapping data from online platforms like Zomato, Swiggy etc. and carry out analysis on the data and provide overall sentiment of the customer for each restaurant. 

Notes : In beautiful soup , we are not able to scroll down the page to scrap all the data. So, used selenium initial to scrap the data and used beautiful soup to pull review from the api link.
